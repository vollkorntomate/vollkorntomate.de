Why every software should be open-source
---

# Transparency
especially about Privacy

# User experience
- easy bug reports and feature requests
- makes a more complete experience for users

# Cost
- bug fixes and features can be implemented by the community; owner still has the upper-hand
- owners have to deal with community => higher cost
- but faster development through community support => earlier release => reduced cost
- "Das ist im Open-Source-Modell anders: Dort werden die Dienstleistungen der Anpassung und Weiterentwicklung laut Holz typischerweise nach dem tatsÃ¤chlichem Arbeitsaufwand abgerechnet" (aus https://netzpolitik.org/2022/onlinezugangsgesetz-mit-open-source-in-richtung-unabhaengigkeit/)

# Security
not necessarily more secure, but potentially

# Sustainability
- not in an environmental sense
- when the developer stops maintaining the app, it annoys users
- community can take over the main work with little effort by the maintainer
- or forks can become the new default version

---

# dealing with common obstacles

## in app purchases
- implementation of these would be publicly known and could be built by anyone
- but: hardly anyone will use this workaround realistically
- license management should be done in backend

## contractors
- a lot of apps are developed by a contractor who wants to earn money
- they can still be the maintainers and still have to deal with the main development, plus community support

## open source != free
- commercial use can still be restricted by appropriate licensing
- using the software may require a license key (checked in backend)
- similar to kerkhoffs principle => algorithm (code) is public, keys (license keys and data) is secret

---

# Open source means responsibility
- taking responsibility for your code
- taking responsibility to accept feedback and bug reports and take them seriously
