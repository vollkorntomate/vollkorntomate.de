## Hi! I am Thomas. ðŸ‘‹

I am 22 years old and live in Munich, Germany. I have a bachelor's degree in informatics from the Technical University of Munich. Throughout the years, I have gained some experience in software development, mostly in Java, Swift and C#.

I love open-source software, open data and the community behind it. I am a defender of privacy and digital rights for an open internet. [Make public data available, protect private data.](https://www.ccc.de/en/hackerethics)

I am interested in IT security and plan on doing a master's degree in that field.

Besides technology, I like learning languages. I speak German natively, English fluently and I consider myself conversational in French and Norwegian. I can understand and speak at least basics in Spanish, Dutch, Arabic and Ukrainian.
