## Hi! I am Thomas. ðŸ‘‹

I am 23 years old and live in Munich and Darmstadt, Germany. I did a bachelor's degree in informatics at the Technical University of Munich and am currently doing a master's degree in IT security at the Technical University of Darmstadt. Through university, internships and smaller side-projects I came to gain some experience in software development, mostly in Java, Swift, C# and Python. Recently, I fell in love with Rust and try to use it more often now. That's why most of my more recent projects have a strong focus on Rust. But still, I love making apps for iOS as well as doing security research and CTFs.

I love open-source software, open data and the community behind it. I am a defender of privacy and digital rights for an open internet. [Make public data available, protect private data.](https://www.ccc.de/en/hackerethics)

Besides technology, I like learning languages. I speak German natively, English fluently and I consider myself conversational in French and Norwegian. I can understand and speak at least basics in Spanish, Dutch, Arabic and Ukrainian.
