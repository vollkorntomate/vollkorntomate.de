## Hi! I am Thomas. ðŸ‘‹

I am a security researcher and hobbyist programmer.

Through learning programming in high school, I discovered a passion and started studying informatics at the Technical University of Munich.
Along the way, I did an internship and a student job at a software engineering firm, through which I got to experience software engineering from a professional side.
During an exchange semester in Norway, I came in contact with the field of cybersecurity, which sparked a great interest in me.
Thus, after I had finished by bachelor's degree in Munich, I moved to Darmstadt and began pursuing a master's degree in cybersecurity at the Technical University of Darmstadt.
I graduated in June 2025 and am now working as a full-time penetration tester.

In my free time, I still enjoy programming, but don't have any large projects that I'm working on.
I love doing CTFs and other hacking challenges for fun and occasionally do some bug hunting.

I am also interested in the political and societal aspects of the digital world. 
I am a supporter of open-source software and open data and I advocate making more software and data openly and freely accessible, while at the same time protecting private data.[^hackerethics]

Besides technology, I really like learning languages.
I am native or near-native in German and English and consider myself conversational in French, Norwegian and Icelandic.
To a lesser extent I can understand and speak some Dutch, Ukrainian and Spanish.
At the university, I did courses in German Sign Language and Arabic, but not much from them has stuck, unfortunately.
